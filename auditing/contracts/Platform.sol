         *      Contract function that differs from destruct() is called which passes in anyone.
         *      If they pass in the auditor or deployer and the contract is not actually destroyed then what?
         *      We do not want to force the destruct() function to be auditor only but that would fix this (assuming vetted + honest auditor)
